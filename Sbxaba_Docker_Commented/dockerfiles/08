docker run -i -t --rm alpine /bin/sh

/*
1.docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] runs a command in a new container.
2.-i/--interactive keeps the STDIN open even if not attached.
3.-t/--tty allocates a pseudo-TTY (pseudo-TTY is a pair of devices *slave & master* that provide a special sort of communication channel).
4.--rm automatically removes the container on exit.
5./bin/sh is the entry point
